# Streaming Stuff

## Test Card (index.html)
Based off https://github.com/makigas/testcard and hacked up for my needs.

## Countdown Timer (countdown.html)

Made from scratch for running timers for things, such as Ads on Twitch.

## VCR Font

No idea where this originally came from. If it ends up having a license, I'll replace it with something else.

## Usage

Deploy to a web server. It's static html. You could probably very easily turn both of these into a streamelements extension pretty easily.
